            <p id="graphics2para">I have been drawing my whole life, but I only got into digital art about 5 years ago. I originally got my Ipad from my sister-in-law who also is an artist (@meggles.art). I was really bad at it in the beginning, but got the hang of it after a while. I post my drawings sometimes, but most of the time I am just sketching for fun, so nothing worth putting online. 3D sculpting is something I also just got into recently, but I'm definitely not as good at that. </p>
